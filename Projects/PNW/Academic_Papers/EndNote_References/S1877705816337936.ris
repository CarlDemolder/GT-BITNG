AB  - This paper presents a multisensory glove to allow prosthetic and robotic hand to simultaneously feel the pressure, temperature, and humidity. The low-cost implementation of the flexible glove with multiple sensors presented here will enable gathering of tactile information from grasped objects. The off-the-shelf components such as pressure, temperature and humidity sensors have been mounted on a flexible printed circuit (FPC) board and attached the glove. During validation most of the sensors were in contact with the grasped objects and successfully measured various contact parameters.
